        <h1>Hi, babyy</h1>
        <p> uhhm I'm sorry if im doing this in a letter I should have said this earlier nung tumawag ako.
            I'm sorry kung nafeel mo na it was forced to like you. I do like you it never feels like you forced mo to like you, having talk to you sa discord always makes me happy 
            even though nag aasaran lang tayo but it takes away all my problems just having a chat with you if you ask me 
            kung ano pwedeng kung baguhin before we start our conversation, I would do the first move and recognise my feelings towards you.
            I really thought that I was gonna lose yesterday, I was crying nung nakikita ko na nirestrict mo na ako or binlock sa mga socmed acc mo 
            and also sa imessage. I'm too scared na mawala ka, im not saying this para mag expect ka ulit no. I just want to say na takot ang mawala ka.
            So let me make it up to you sa mga nagawa ko, I know I should have do this earlier and I'm sorry for that. Im sorry if di ko magawang sabihin sayo to nang nasa call 
            I want to better para sayo im trying pero im sorry if hindi mo nakikita but believe me im trying to be better not only for me but also para satin 
            I love you so much baby, I don't want to start over again with someone 
        </p>
